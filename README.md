## Signing Up

4. Enter a strong password. It needs to be at least 8 characters long; ideally a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters
![enter password](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/d0d7ec06-1ca5-4a4e-a9e2-780ab83738b4)

Once your password is entered, your account will be temporarily locked and you will be redirected to authenticate your account using a simple challenge. 
![account locked](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/604d98d2-52bb-4f91-b5bc-dff088d74c7b)

This is a security feature recently designed to prevent bots from creating accounts on Twitter. The challenge requires the user to solve a puzzle or identify specific objects in an image to prove that they are a human and not a bot. It looks something like this:
![Arkose challenge](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/f7f16a7c-2fc0-49b4-9209-d5514dbfef13)

Use the arrows to redirect the image in the right to face the same direction as the hand on the left image. Once done, your account will be unlocked. Click **Continue To Twitter** to continue to Twitter’s web interface. 
![accpount unlocked page](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/01eb9e88-a8b2-453f-bcb6-f53ef21ca701)

Now you can set up your profile. 

## Setting Up
### Changing Your Username
On the web interface, click the **More** icon, located at the bottom of the dashboard at the left of the screen.
![More Icon](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/15baf783-3e47-489a-a111-4aee18d04958)

A drop-down menu appears, and in the drop-down menu, select the **Settings and Support** tab. Under it, select **Settings and Privacy**. 
![Highlighting settings and support tab](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/f910e170-9acd-4223-82bb-ba210c3a2b8a)

Once redirected, click on **Account Information** in the **Your Account** section. 
![Twitter Settings - Your Account page](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/ce8125db-6fdf-4965-abe0-73246907f49f)

Confirm you are the one authorising this action by entering your password. 
![password confirmation page](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/86ce7f5b-fdc7-47ba-a63a-3ce3e532606f)

You can adjust or edit your account details, including your username. Click on the **Username** setting (the first on the page), to change the default username to a name of your choice. 
![username setting](https://github.com/jamesalexakande/Twitter-Web-User-Guide/assets/145064527/29fcd761-4273-4e94-bdfb-e598aeacae1c)

If the username is available, the text field will remain unchanged. If the text field is red, the username is taken and you have to choose another one. Click **Save** when you are done. 

After this, Twitter tells you once again to take a security challenge to confirm your changes (just like in the *Signing Up* section). Once you have confirmed by passing the test, your username is changed.

### Reposts/Retweets
Retweets allow you to share another user’s post to your followers for broader reach. 
You can retweet a post by clicking on the two squared arrows underneath the tweet. Once you do this, a list of options will pop up. 

Click **Repost** if you wish to instantly share the post with your followers without leaving your own comments or thoughts.
Click **Quote** if you wish to add your own words, photos or videos. 

## Notifications
The notifications bar displays reactions by other users to your posts, comments, or reposts by others. It is split into three sections:

- **All**, which shows you notifications from the platform, as well as reactions from other users. 
- **Verified**, which shows you notification from verified users.  
- **Mentions**, which notifies you when other users mention your username on their posts.
